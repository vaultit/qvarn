# This file lists Python modules that DO NOT have corresponding unit

# The Python build script. It makes no sense to have unit tests for

# The module namespace file. It makes no sense to have unit tests for
# this.
qvarn/__init__.py

# The database abstraction layer. This is meant to be simple and obvious
# enough that unit tests are not needed.
qvarn/sql.py

# The backend application main program. This does things like parsing
# the command line or starting the HTTP server. These are things that
# do not benefit much from unit tests, and are better tested by system
# level tests, to avoid having to mock the universe.
qvarn/backend_app.py

# Classes for different resources.
# These don't do enough things that make sense to unit test. These get
# tested properly by system level tests, especially the API test suite.

qvarn/simple_resource.py
qvarn/listener_resource.py
qvarn/file_resource.py

# This only logs an HTTP request. That's something that it doesn't make a lot
# sense to unit test (it'd just require mocking and verifying that the right
# log function gets called, and that's not worth the effort).

# TODO
qvarn/basic_validation_plugin.py
qvarn/error_transform_plugin.py

# A very simple class that got written without unit tests. Might be
# worthwhile to remove
qvarn/measurement.py

# Does not contain much logic, logic is mostly separated to AuthValidator and
# util.py
qvarn/authorization_plugin.py

# Contains only subclasses of QvarnException that don't add any additional
# functionality.
qvarn/http_statuses.py

# Contains version number.
