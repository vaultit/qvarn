NEWS for Qvarn
==============

Version 0.81+git, not yet released
----------------------------------

* Added some documentation for resource type definition.

* Mantas added the /limit and /offset operators to /search. This
  should be useful for implemenating pagination in API clients.

* Made the Transaction class handle exceptions when committing or
  rolling back a database transaction, and not leak database
  connections. Reported by Marius Gedminas.

* Qvarn can now log up to five log files simultanously. Each file can
  have its own filtering rules.

* Qvarn now rotates its log files as soon as they become longer than
  the specified limit. The current log file gets renamed to have a
  timestamp, and a new log file is created with the specified name.

* Qvarn now logs when it starts using a Postgres connection or stops
  using it. These are done with the log message types `get_conn` and
  `put_conn` respectively.

Version 0.81, released 2017-03-10
----------------------------------

* Mantas added sorting of results to searches.

* Lars Wirzenius has changed Qvarn to consist of a single backend
  process (`qvarn-backend`), which serves all resource types. Also,
  Qvarn now reads the resource type specifications from YAML files
  (`/etc/qvarn/*.yaml`; previously `src/*` Python scripts), and a
  single configuration file (`/etc/qvarn/qvarn.conf`). Qvarn no longer
  supports resource type specific validation code. Such functionality
  may return later by making the resource type specification language
  have a stronger type system.

  Note that resource types may not yet be managed via the API. That
  will come in the future (trouble with Gluu and limitations of its
  API prevented this from being finished; some of API code is already
  in Qvarn, but is not to be used).

  All previously existing resource types are still included with
  Qvarn. Some of the application specific ones may be dropped in the
  future, but not in this release.

  Note that deployment/provisioning needs to adapt to the above. For
  example, the qvarn-prepare systemd unit needs to use
  `/usr/bin/qvarn-backend` instead of the now-deleted
  `/usr/bin/qvarn-prepare`. Also only one config file should be
  created. uwsgi should only run one program (with a suitable number
  of threads). haproxy should only have one Qvarn backend. See
  qvarn-prov.git for an example.

Version 0.80, released 2017-02-17
----------------------------------

* Ville Niskala added a wildcard listener feature to allow listening
  on all notifications for a specific resource type. See the API
  manual for details.

Version 0.79, released 2017-01-26
----------------------------------

* Lars Wirzenius changed `slog-errors` to treat any log messages with
  a Python traceback to be errors.

* The `person` resource type has a new field `gluu_user_id`.

Version 0.78, released 2016-11-18
----------------------------------

* Ville Niskala added new resource types: `data_cache`, `files`,
  `jobs`, `resource_accesses`.

Version 0.77, released 2016-10-24
----------------------------------

* Added the `bolagsfakta_supplier` resource type, from Programmers of
  Vilnius.

* Fixed bug in Qvarn related to handling deep JSON prototypes,
  reported by Ville Niskala (Tilaajavastuu).

Version 0.76, released 2016-10-17
----------------------------------

* Fix /show so it only shows those fields that are specified (plus
  `id`).

* Validation of field values for `ID06_cards` contract types have been
  removed, in order to simplify ID06 application development.

Version 0.75, released 2016-10-12
----------------------------------

* Logging of non-UTF8 strings has been fixed. This in turn fixes
  uploads of binary files.

Version 0.74, released 2016-09-20
----------------------------------

* The structured log of Qvarn now includes log messages from the
  standard Python logging library. This is useful when the bottle.py
  framework or one of the library Qvarn uses emits log messags of its
  own. They now all end up in the same structured log file as Qvarn's
  own messages.

* Qvarn's HTTP responses now have a `Date:` header. Thanks to Teemu
  Kääriäinen for reporting the issue.

* A fix to `/search` by Ville Niskala. The bug caused OR conditions to
  fail if there were no corresponding rows in a joined table.

* New `/search` operators: `contains`, `startswith`, and `show`. The
  former follow the pattern of `exact`, but `show` takes a single
  parameter, which is a top-level field name and includes that field
  in the response. It may be used multiple times.

* Updates to the contracts and competence type resources, by Ville
  Niskala.

Version 0.73, released 2016-07-27
----------------------------------

Bug fixes:

* Qvarn now fails to start if its configuration lacks the fields to
  check authentication (i.e., checking the validity of access tokens).
  This means configuration files now MUST define `token_issuer` and
  `token_validation_key`. If they're not set, Qvarn doesn't start.
  This prevents accidentally running Qvarn in an insecure mode.

* The "competence type" resource is now systematically spelled with an
  underscore ("competence_types") instead of sometimes using a dash.
  This prevents much confusion and error.

Small changes:

* Manuals are now built using `qvdoc`, with Qvarn logo and everything.
  Also, Qvarn version is now used as document version.

* The single structured log message of type `critical` is now `error`,
  like all other errors.

* `slog-error` considers a HTTP status code of 400 or greater to
  indicate a failure. Previously it was 500 or greater.

* `slog-error` reports the filename from which it gets the log
  messages it reports.

* Debian packaging for Qvarn now depends on `python-yaml`.

Developer-only changes:

* Many code cleanups. Hopefully no bugs introduced (tests still pass).
  Most importantly, `src/*` are now using shared code
  (`ResourceServer`) to set up an application, based on a data
  description. The description still needs to be Python code in `src`,
  but this is a big step towards liberating Qvarn installations to
  specify the resources they need via configuration files.

* The source tree no longer has obsolete configuration file snippets.

Version 0.72, released 2016-07-05
----------------------------------

* The `/version` now reports the correct version number.

* Qvarn now uses structured logs. These are logs where each line is in
  JSON. See the `slog-pretty` and `slog-errors` utilities for reading
  such logs. Logs (in JSON) may also be sent to syslog by configuring
  main.log variable as `syslog`.

* Resources can now have a structure that is one depth deeper than
  before, and Qvarn gives an error if they're too deep. Thanks to
  Ville Niskala for reporting the problem.

Version 0.71, released 2016-05-26
----------------------------------

* Some source code cleanups have been made to placate the pylint tool.
  This should not be visible to users.

* Put back the `org.is_luotettava_kumppani_member` field, which got
  dropped earlier. A client application is using it and it's faster to
  un-break Qvarn by adding the field than to ask them to fix their
  end. We'll re-remove the field later, at a more opportune moment.

Version 0.70, released 2016-05-25
----------------------------------

* Improve speed of searches by dropping the previous approach
  (COUNT(id) turns out to be slow in Postgres) and using INNER JOIN
  instead. By Ville Niskala.

Version 0.69, released 2016-05-24
----------------------------------

* Attempt to improve the speed of search queries, by Ville Niskala.
  This version attempts to avoid unnecessary queries, and to implement
  an AND between conditions in a more efficient way. However, this
  hasn't been benchmarked yet: this release is to enable benchmarks to
  be run.

Version 0.68, released 2016-05-23
----------------------------------

* No-change release, to trigger a new build. Sorry.

Version 0.67, released 2016-05-23
----------------------------------

* Missing build dependencies added to Debian packaging.

Version 0.66, released 2016-05-23
----------------------------------

* This is the first release with a NEWS file.
